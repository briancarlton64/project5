# project5
This project was designed to test basic GUI implementation, as well as integration with previous projects focused on the Hamming Distance of strings in Java.
Initially, I underestimated the time it would take to complete the project, as it took well over 5 hours, double the time I usually take on projects.
This is due mainly to the unfortunately tedious nature of GUI programming, which is mainly implementation focused v.s. what I prefer, algorithm design.

# Default section
On the left of the Java application is the default requirement for the lab. Most of it was fairly easy to implement, and most of the calculation methods for the default section are contained in the "static" class HammingDist.

# Creative Dection
For the "creative" section I decided to show some of the under-the-hood workings of the application by allowing users to input 4 characters and see their ASCII total, and compare that to the selected values.

# What was Learned
Overall, I gained a greater understanding of not only GUI programming itself, but also some of the tedium it entails. I imagine most proffesionals would rather use design tools than reinvent the wheel each time. However, in order to gain a true understanding of the task you're undertaking, you must know the implementation details. Much like there are GUI tools for Git and terminal for navigating Windows: they're more powerful in their implementation, but also entail less efficiency.
